# Condipes-1.0

 This was my first web project, it's a app that takes the user input of actual player's stats 
from old gen PES and returns the stats modified by the condition chart on PES 6 Official Guide on a table.
 I did it to share with the Pes 6 community, so feel free to use this idea or code into your project.

I used a lot of Html code back then, but it helps me to improve my skills.
